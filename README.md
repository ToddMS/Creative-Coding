# Creative Coding Project

This project showcases a series of creative coding sketches developed using JavaScript. Each sketch explores different programming concepts and visual techniques, demonstrating my ability to create interactive and visually compelling web experiences.

## Sketch Summaries

### Sketch 1: Canvas Transformations and Angles

- **Angles**: Focuses on rotating shapes, converting angles from degrees to radians, and using trigonometry to distribute shapes around a circle.
- **Utility Functions**: Introduces scaling and the use of a library of utility functions to streamline code.
- **Arcs**: Completes the sketch by drawing arcs and using random values to vary parameters, adding dynamic visuals.

### Sketch 2: Objects, Classes, and Animating Agents

- **Animating Agents**: Introduces object-oriented programming with objects and classes, creating agents that move within the canvas.
- **Lines**: Teaches how to draw lines between agents, optimize performance, and use Pythagoras' theorem to calculate distances between agents.
- **Video Output**: Demonstrates how to export the sketch as a video file, allowing for easy sharing and presentation.

### Sketch 3: Noise and Grid with Real-Time GUI

- **Grid**: Explores a more efficient and flexible method of creating grids within the canvas.
- **Noise**: Adds randomness to the grid using noise generators, making the visuals more organic and less predictable.
- **GUI**: Implements a Graphical User Interface (GUI) with sliders, enabling real-time adjustments to sketch parameters.

### Sketch 4: Text Manipulation and Asynchronous Functions

- **Text**: Focuses on working with text, including drawing, measuring, and setting font properties within the canvas.
- **Async**: Introduces asynchronous functions and handling keyboard events to interact with the sketch dynamically.
- **Bitmap**: Utilizes a secondary canvas as a data source and reads pixel values to influence the visual output.
- **Glyphs**: Concludes the sketch by drawing small glyphs that combine to form a larger, complex visual.

## Project Overview

This project highlights my ability to apply programming concepts creatively, developing interactive and visually appealing web experiences. Each sketch demonstrates a different facet of my technical skills and creative problem-solving abilities, making me well-prepared for roles in front-end development and creative coding.
